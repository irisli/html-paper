                <h1>Filler text</h1>
                <p>Filler text (also placeholder text or dummy text) is text that shares some characteristics of a real written text, but is random or otherwise generated. It may be used to display a sample of fonts, generate text for testing, or to spoof an e-mail spam filter. The process of using filler text is sometimes called Greeking, although the text itself may be nonsense, or largely Latin, as in Lorem ipsum.</p>

                <h2>Asdf</h2>
                <p>ASDF is the sequence of letters that appear on the first four keys on the home row of a QWERTY or QWERTZ keyboard. They are often used as a sample or test case or as random, meaningless nonsense. It is also a common learning tool for keyboard classes, since all four keys are located on Home row.</p>

                <h2>Etaoin shrdlu</h2>
                <p>ETAOIN SHRDLU is the approximate order of frequency of the twelve most commonly used letters in the English language, best known as a nonsense phrase that sometimes appeared in print in the days of &quot;hot type&quot; publishing due to a custom of Linotype machine operators.</p>
